Next Steps for Improvement
Model Architecture:

Experiment with deeper U-Net architectures, residual blocks, or attention mechanisms for better performance.
Data Augmentation:

Apply audio augmentation techniques like pitch shifting, time-stretching, and noise addition to make your model more robust.
Metrics:

Incorporate more advanced separation metrics like SDR (Signal-to-Distortion Ratio), SIR (Signal-to-Interference Ratio), and SAR (Signal-to-Artifacts Ratio).
Pre-trained Models:

You can explore using pre-trained models for source separation, such as those trained on the MUSDB18 dataset.
